Just something i decided to try out

to run the code just simply run the run.bat file
you will be prompted with a list of music files. you can play with no music by pressing enter.
after the game will run and you can move around using w/space to jump a to move left and d to move right.
you can also type these into the command prompt terminal and it will work the same.
